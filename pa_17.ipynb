For example, suppose you have a text file with lines that start with a timestamp and you want to extract the text after the timestamp. Using a look-ahead assertion, you can define a pattern like `(?<=\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2} \\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2} )(.*$)`. This pattern matches the text following the timestamp without including the timestamp itself in the result. The look-ahead assertion allows you to define the condition without consuming the timestamp characters.\n",

For example, suppose you have a program that analyzes a document and identifies sentences that contain both a specific keyword and a specific phrase. By using look-ahead assertions, you can define a pattern that checks for the presence of both criteria without consuming any characters. This allows you to efficiently identify and process sentences that meet the complex matching conditions.\n",

    "1. Tokenization: The `Scanner` interface allows you to tokenize a string by defining specific patterns to match and extract individual tokens. It provides a convenient way to break down a string into meaningful units based on your defined patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterative Parsing: The `Scanner` interface provides an iterator-based approach to parsing. You can iterate over the matched tokens one by one, which is especially useful when working with large or dynamically generated strings. This iterative parsing allows you to process the tokens in a streaming fashion without loading the entire string into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Custom Actions: With the `Scanner` interface, you can associate custom actions or functions with specific patterns. These actions can be executed whenever a particular pattern is matched, allowing you to perform additional processing or handling specific to that pattern. It provides more flexibility in defining the behavior for different types of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Error Handling: The `Scanner` interface includes error handling capabilities, such as raising exceptions or providing error messages, when a given pattern does not match or when an unexpected token is encountered. This allows you to handle parsing errors and react accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stateful Parsing: The `Scanner` interface supports maintaining state during parsing. It allows you to define and update variables or flags as you process each token. This stateful parsing enables more complex parsing scenarios where the behavior or pattern matching may depend on the previous tokens encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the `re.findall` function is primarily focused on finding all non-overlapping matches of a given pattern in a string and returning them as a list. It doesn't offer the same level of flexibility, tokenization, iterative parsing, custom actions, error handling, or stateful parsing that the `Scanner` interface provides.\n",
